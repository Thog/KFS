//! Server wrappers around IPC Buffers
//!
//! IPC Servers may accept different kinds of IPC Buffers, in order to move
//! around large amounts of data efficiently. There exists two kinds of IPC
//! Buffers, the Pointers and the Buffers.
//!
//! Pointers work in a pair of input and output: the Server pushes an InPointer
//! while the Client pushes an OutPointer. The kernel will memcpy the contents of
//! the OutPointer to the appropriate InPointer of the other side.
//!
//! Buffers work by remapping the memory from the sender to the receiver. The in
//! and out simply decide whether the memory is remapped as read-only or write-
//! only (on supported platforms. On platforms that don't have write-only memory,
//! it will be mapped RW instead).
//!
//! Those types are not meant to be used directly. Instead, you should get them
//! as arguments from the [object macro](crate::ipc::macros).
//!
//! The types will auto-deref to their underlying type, allowing the user to
//! manipulate them as if they were normal pointers.
